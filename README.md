### Primary Colors
Red, Yellow, and Blue make up the primary colors. These are colors that can not be mixed and tend to command the most attention (Think of road signs and logos.)
### Secondary Colors
These are colors that are comprised of two primary colors. They are orange, green, and purple. 
### Complimentary Colors
Colors that are oposite to eachother on the color wheel. The complments are:
* Red and Green
* Yellow and Purple
* Blue and Orange

### Warm and Cool colors
The rainbow can be split into warm and cool colors. Red, orange, yellow, and pink would all be considered warm colors. They tend to sigmify warmth, positity, and are intensity. The cool colors are blue, indigo, green and purple. They tend to be more mellow and signify calmness and/or sadness. Black and white are not colors in this kind of sense, but various shaded (including greys) can have warm or cool undertones, depending on the color it is mixed with. 

All colors can have a 'Warm' and 'Cool' version, depending on the shade (For exaple, a more purpley-red is a cool red, and a orangey-red is a warm red)

## Real aplications of color theory
### Mixing Colors
Color relationships are extremely important when mixing colors when painting. It is vital to know that Complimentary colors, when mixed, produce a brown or grey (Called neutralizing). This also applys to shades. Blue and red make purple, but when a warm red (that is closer to orange) is mixed with a blue, it will produce a very grey purple tone.
